con_arg_13,"the government just want the economy to return to normal , they do not care how well this is tested .",government_eco
con_arg_14,The government might be in a rush to get a vaccine onto the market so that the population can gain immunity faster. A population with immunity means that businesses can begin to open and thus the economy can begin to grow again. ,government_eco
con_arg_15,There hasn't been time to sufficiently test it considering how new the virus is. The government is more interested in getting people back to work and not losing money and so they would allow it anyway. They have already shown they are willing to risk people's lives with herd immunity and how slow they were locking the country down compared to others. Why would I trust them now?,government_eco
con_arg_16,"That's not necessarily true. Lots of companies and governments act in their own self-interest or for profit or image, rather than actual merit.",government_eco
con_arg_17,The government cares more about finding a solution as quick as possible to prevent economy recession rather than ensuring the best care possible for its people. Pharmaceutical companies are money-driven.,government_eco
con_arg_18,"The process of getting this vaccine out is being rushed though and people are under a lot of pressure to make it work, so it's much easier for mistakes to be made plus we can't guarantee that all information would be made available to the public. The government need this to work to boost the economy.",government_eco

con_arg_20,"Politicians dont care about people, they want to get out of the recession as fast as possible",government_eco
con_arg_21,But who's going to pay for it anyway. It will be the taxpayer in some form or another. ,government_tax
con_arg_22,Govt subsidies are coming out of the pockets of the taxpayers so they are still paying for it. Cutting costs may mean that the product is not up to scratch,government_tax
con_arg_23,So we pay via taxes instead... we still pay.,government_tax

con_arg_39,The government will be speeding up the process because of the pressure and therefore will not be following usual health and safety procedures. The government want good news stories.,government_trust
con_arg_40,"I think the government would, as they are under pressure to get a vaccine out quickly, so they will push through the testing phase quickly ",government_trust
con_arg_41,The Government are rushing through testing and using whatever they can find,government_trust
con_arg_42,"Untrue, with the current situation the government are under immense pressure to produce a vaccine in a much quicker time. I would not be one of the first to take the vaccine as side effects are sure to happen.",government_trust
con_arg_43,"How can you be sure its any less safe, this vaccine is being rushed not only so governments seem to be doing something proactive but also to make someone, whoever discovers a vaccine, very rich. The health and wellbeing of people is not being put ahead of the need to appear to be doing something.",government_trust
con_arg_44,"Due to the nature of covid and the speed in which it has spread, governments may be more concerned with getting a vaccine out to appease the public rather than testing it as thoroughly as it should be tested.",government_trust
con_arg_45,The government will do what makes tbem money  they don't care about us.,government_trust
con_arg_46,Governments are more concerned with getting a vaccine out quickly and may accept findings from other countries research rather than conducting their own to save time,government_trust
con_arg_47,If it works on a few people I'm sure governments would still call it a success. They all want to be seen to be 'the first' to come up with a cure/ vaccine.,government_trust
con_arg_48,The government aren't renowned for relaying accurate information. I am sure the same was said before they introduced Thalidomide.,government_trust
con_arg_49,"I do not trust everything the government says, they have lied before and can lie again just to get people to inject themselves with possibly dangerous vaccines",government_trust
con_arg_50,Some would say the government is very corrupt and therefore should not have complete trust in the government and companies that market vaccines. A lot of misinformation can be spread around and thus one may not trust in the information given to them when taking the vaccine.,government_trust
con_arg_51,I don't trust companies or the government. Private companies and government regularly partake in activities which destroy our natural environment and put peoples health at risk. ,government_trust
con_arg_52,The governement and companies are more interested in money than peoples health.,government_trust

con_arg_57,"I feel that we are in the problems with COVID because the government didn't act soon enough, why should I trust them now?",government_trust
con_arg_58,Money And the economy and the tax receipts to the government is the reason we didn't go into lockdown earlier when much more lives could have been saved then than would be now the virus has passed its peak,government_trust
con_arg_59,"Most vaccines are tested for long term affects, due to the time line of the COVID vaccine trials we wont know if the vaccine could have side affects that dont show up till later down the line. ",long_term_effects
con_arg_60,The trials only test the short-term effects of the vaccine. Long-term effects would not be known until much later.,long_term_effects
con_arg_61,"However, long term side effects cannot be analysed due to the time constraints placed on researchers to manufacture a vaccine, as it can take many years for vaccines to be sufficiently tested, for side effects and efficacy, and this amount of time is just not viable as a vaccine is needed quickly to potentially cope with a second influx of cases. In addition, if a vaccine is not tested on certain demographics of people, then some people with certain illnesses may respond negatively to the vaccine and have a severe reaction to the dose. ",long_term_effects
con_arg_62,This vaccination has been prepared under immense time pressure. Nobody know if there will be long lasting side effects!,long_term_effects
con_arg_63,"I think that too, but they will only know if there are short time side effects.There is no way of knowing the long term side effects of the vaccine.",long_term_effects
con_arg_64,Im sure short term testing will be carried out but what about long term affects? All companies and countries are racing to have the first vaccine available on the market this will undoubtedly lead to corners being cut. ,long_term_effects
con_arg_65,"These medications have been tested over many years with very large groups of people to get accurate data, yes it is understandable that there will be reactions to the new vaccine no matter what, but to full understand all the long term effects a study needs to be carried out over a longer period with more people at different stages.",long_term_effects
con_arg_66,This is misleading and unfair for customers. There may be long term side effects that people are unaware of due to the medicine being released too early on which actually outweigh the possible COVID symptoms. ,long_term_effects
con_arg_67,Again you can't be sure of the long term risks or hidden risks that could occur,long_term_effects
con_arg_68,The long term effect of the vaccines cannot be determined so all the results just apply for short term use. ,long_term_effects
con_arg_69,Previously research has found that drugs have been ineffective after years of people using them as you begin to notice the long-term effects of them. ,long_term_effects
con_arg_70,"Vaccines always take long time to analise the side effect and the long term effect of the vaccine itself on the person who received it. Rushing for the COVID vaccine means risking many side effects which are not yet clear, whilst we now know hot to tackle Corona",long_term_effects
con_arg_71,"If the vaccine has been developed quickly, we cannot be sure what are the short-term and long-term side effects because it has been produced so quickly.",long_term_effects
con_arg_72,"I do not believe that, how can anyone no what long term side effects will have on anyone when developing some thing new so quickly ",long_term_effects
con_arg_73,Some people don't get any symptoms with COVID but would possibly get some bad side effects with the vaccine - what about them? If you have developed the vaccine quickly how can you know the long term effect of these side effects? How can you be sure you know all the side effects possible especially when it comes to different people with health issues etc. Especially the side effects when it comes to those most vulnerable to COVID like people with COPD or asthma.,long_term_effects
con_arg_74,The speed up has been pushed by the economical crisis and psicological need for people to feel safer. You can have as many clinica tests to  believe is safe but no long term consequences results therefore NO safe still!,long_term_effects
con_arg_75,"As stated above, while more clinical tests are taking place,  we don't know whether they are being tested for long enough to fully understand it's effects. ",long_term_effects
con_arg_76,"There may be more money and resource going into it but you cannot make more time out of nowhere. Trials take time, you need to see what will happen to the subjects 1, 3, 6 months down the line. No amount of money can help speed that up.",long_term_effects
con_arg_77,clinical tests may be being done a lot but we still do not know of any long term effects.,long_term_effects
con_arg_78,"The shorter period of time that the clinical tests are performed over may not give a true representation of the full range of side effects. For example, some side effects may only present themselves a year after exposure to the potentially unsafe drug. We cannot assume that because more clinical tests have taken place in a shorter amount of time, that the validity of this data is equal to that of other vaccine trials that have taken place over a longer period of time.",long_term_effects
con_arg_79,But we don't even know what the longterm complications are - vaccine could cause similar,long_term_effects
con_arg_80,"Side effect may be worse than the virus itself, someone could be allergic to it for some unknown reason, they die due to the vaccine ",side_effects
con_arg_81,If my risk for COVID is very low then I'll take that chance rather than experiencing side effects. ,side_effects
con_arg_82,"But they're rushing it, how can we be sure they are being as careful when it normally takes years to create a successful fairly side effect free vaccine? ",side_effects
con_arg_83,"How are they researched, what are the multiple stages. What are the side effects are they worse than covid itself.",side_effects
con_arg_84,"The side effects aren't known yet, and so you can't claim they are lower risk or safer. ",side_effects
con_arg_85,with any vaccinestion they go under many test before the get relised and when they do they is around 1/1000000 chance that you will get a side effect,side_effects
con_arg_86,"Mistakes can still be made, they could miss a side effect that will lead to many deaths",side_effects
con_arg_87,"The amount of people being tested is probably only a very small group because there are fewer cases due to lockdown, so we don't have a full picture of the side effects.",side_effects
con_arg_88,How can you know that the risk is higher for covid than the side effects when covid is different for alot of people? Some people don't even have symptoms with covid. ,side_effects
con_arg_89,what if some of the side effects include potentialy untreatable symptoms? I do not want to get a vaccine if during the multiple stages of trials something gets overlooked.,side_effects
con_arg_90,I'm not a person that has a higher risk and since we don't know what are the side effects of the vaccine I think the later represents a higher risk,side_effects
con_arg_91,"However, the side effects from the vaccination may be more serious than symptoms of COVID which may be something that many people may not want to risk. How does one know that the vaccine is trust worthy and that companies don't just want to sell products regardless of the consequences?",side_effects
con_arg_92,There is no way of knowing the potential side effects that could occur years later.,side_effects
con_arg_93,"History has had the same argument time and time again saying no time to waste, but we have mutated our future children, (thalidomide), injured and killed thousands (The Cutter incident) and we still have no clue why darker skinned people due to melatonin have such a high risk of death from covid-19 and what out of the 3 main vaccine choices side effects could be. ",side_effects
con_arg_94,"They would if they are desperate to be seen to be doing something, even if it does have some side effects, known or unknown.",side_effects
con_arg_95,History has proven that that isnt the case. There have been many drugs and treatments in the past that have been withdrawn once we realised the true affects of them. ,side_effects
con_arg_96,"Companies sell products with negative side effects all the time, as long as they make money they don't care",side_effects
con_arg_97,"Some companies may focus on the financial gain that they receive from the vaccine if it is a private company as the vaccine will be required globally and profit may be first priority before the minimisation of side effects. Also, some medical products have quite a variety of side effects after administration and so the vaccine could have a lot of common, but moderate side effects, such as nausea, fatigue, etc. which would mean that there are a lot of side effects, and they have not been minimised. ",side_effects
con_arg_98,"Wrong, you might have a different side effect than someone who has heart problems or any other long going issue",side_effects
con_arg_99,The benefits do not outweigh the risks for those that do experience the side effects particularly if they are severe or even life threatening ,side_effects
con_arg_100,"My sister has been on multiple medications before where there were 'only sever side effects in a small amount of cases' but she still managed to get them, even ones that hadn't been listed before. I'm not sure the benefits really do outweigh the risks when we can't be sure exactly if there are any more side effects of a vaccine that haven't been found in the short amount of testing time.",side_effects

con_arg_103,"You can stop taking medication though, it's different with a vaccine. The side effects are more likely to be permanent. ",side_effects
con_arg_104,Some medicines have awful side effects. Looking at past cases this has happened!,side_effects
con_arg_105,"The level of panic surrounding COVID has already allowed the vaccine to be rushed through with much less scrutiny than would usually be required. The 'places' which are developing vaccines are actually mostly companies who operate for a profit. The company that successfully produces the vaccine will sell it worldwide, as there will be huge pressure from populations on the government to get the vaccine as fast as they can. This means that potentially a vaccine developed in a mostly mono ethinic and mono cultural environment could be shipped out to all corners of the globe and be given to populations which could have adverse reactions to it based on their genetic characteristics. Once one vaccine has been found, its very unlikely that any other company would continue to develop its own vaccine because its profitability would be slashed. ",side_effects
con_arg_106,"Even after sufficient testing there still may be unknown risks depending on different circumstances, e.g other health conditions ",side_effects
con_arg_107,"Although it's important we reduce cases of covid19,we also must be wary of the side effects and the amount of research that will go into making the vaccine",side_effects
con_arg_108,"But what if the side effects are even worse than COVID, and you're in a particularly low-risk category?",side_effects
con_arg_109,"Covid has changed side effects as it has progressed, therefore testing cannot be conclusive, so neither can the side effects be predicted,  people want to return to normal",side_effects
con_arg_110,"The side effects, if present, will effect everyone that gets the vaccine whereas covid will on effect those that catch it. Is it worth giving millions or billions of people an unsafe vaccine just in case they catch covid?",side_effects
con_arg_111,Why risk getting a vaccine that has been rushed through if you will also have to contend with side effects. Double risk,side_effects
con_arg_112,we cant be sure of all the side effects as yet as it has not been tested enough,side_effects
con_arg_113,"COVID 19 has a global mortality rate of 3.4%, whilst the chances of negative side effects from a vaccine are currently unknown. We cannot risk exposing ourselves to a drug which the chances of side effects are currently unknown. Therefore, we must assume that the probability of developing side effects are greater than the mortality rate of COVID 19. More time must be taken to develop a safe and effective vaccine. ",side_effects
con_arg_114,"Not true, vaccines which have had more time being developed by researchers are much less likely to develop problems in patients. Some vaccines have been known to cause brain damage in the first set of testers which ultimately is irreversible so potentially getting sick from COVID providing you don't die may be the better option.",side_effects

con_arg_123,Such a vaccine could potentially come with severe side-effects if it comes out too soon and is not particularly well-researched,side_effects

con_arg_138, But there is no guarantee of that and also it cannot be guaranteed that I will develop complications down the line owing to the vaccine,side_effects
con_arg_139, But there may be effects that you  may not be aware of yet,side_effects
con_arg_140, Much like we have yet to fully figure out the full range of complications of COVID 19 we would not know if the vaccine is fully effective to combat all of it,side_effects

con_arg_143, Yes but we can't be sure it's effective,side_effects
con_arg_144,  I am unconvinced how effective the vaccine will be though,side_effects
con_arg_145,But getting a vaccine wouldn't make me feel safe. I don't want to be a guinea pig in something that's being rushed through at a much faster pace than that of the development of any other vaccine.,testing
con_arg_146," Again, there is no guarantee of the vaccines effectiveness based on how quickly it has been produced",testing
con_arg_147,"This situation is unprecedented, there is no way that they can do as much testing as normal.",testing
con_arg_148,And their is no evidence of sufficient testing at the moment yet you wish the public to proceed.,testing

con_arg_150,There isn't enough time for enough testing to be carried out.,testing
con_arg_151,"Human testing has already been allowed after adapting previous vaccines that were not at the human testing stage so No there is proof we are rushing it and sufficient testing is definitely not being carried out  the first person to have a trial vaccine (Jennifer Haller , Seattle,  WA) may not get side effects but clearly if we are at the stage of human testing after 4 months not 18 months we still do not have the evidence testing is being sufficient. ",testing
con_arg_152,I agree with this in almost all cases. This is because medicines and vaccines are developed and tested over a long period of time. The COVID vaccine is currently being rushed through testing. Normally a vaccine takes 10-15 years to develop and be tested. 18 months is far too short of a time  to test a vaccine for wide population use.  The panic associated with COVID is allowing this vaccine to be rushed through with almost no public or government intervention. Also the idea of everyone having to take a vaccine for an illness that only seems to have a profound effect on a very small number of the population is far more risky than just making the vaccine available to at risk groups.,testing
con_arg_153,"But there is a risk that not enough testing could be carried out on a large sample to be able to see how common severe side effects might be. For example, a vaccine would need to be tested on a few thousand people to determine the incidence rate of the severe side effects. As well as, the need to test on people with underlying health conditions and account for how people with certain illnesses could react severely to the vaccine.",testing
con_arg_154,"But the countries arent working together, its every country for the self. So the population tested is low",testing
con_arg_155,Not been tested for very long so might not be safe. Would be better if tested for longer,testing

con_arg_157,It needs a lot of tests and that may take many years in order to ensure the safety,testing
con_arg_158,I would only ever get a vaccine like that if it had been vigorously been tested and been about for a while e.g 2 years already ,testing
con_arg_159,"It can be a while before vaccine safety concerns are recognised (such as with the Lyme disease vaccine) and I would worry that a vaccine may be put on the market prematurely in a rush to solve the COVID-19 situation, that may not have been tested adequately. ",testing

con_arg_163," Yes, but how long have the trials been going on. I know trials usually take years to be deemed as safe.",testing
con_arg_164,the virus may mutate and then such a vaccine will be ineffective,mutation
con_arg_165,If it is proven that COVID-19 mutates fast and strong (which I sincerely hope is not the case) a vaccine may be useless,mutation

con_arg_190,Herd immunity can be achieved by letting those of us with strong immune systems catch the virus and develop natural immunity,natural_hi
con_arg_191, the virus can cause herd immunity without the vaccine,natural_hi
con_arg_192, No herd immunity is due to being exposed to the virus not from a vaccine,natural_hi
con_arg_193,Immunity should be achieved by letting everyone catch the disease,natural_hi
con_arg_194,Herd immunity can be achieved by letting people get covid and naturally develop it,natural_hi
con_arg_195," How about letting nature take its course and becoming naturally immune, with good proven medical intervention that is so far proven to keep us alive",natural_hi
con_arg_196, Wearing face masks and social distancing makes me feel safe,alternative_protection
con_arg_197, I will protect other people by wearing a mask and social distancing,alternative_protection
con_arg_198,I already feel safe in crowded places with social distancing and good hygiene measures.,alternative_protection
con_arg_199, I don't meet with vulnerable people and obey social distancing rules,alternative_protection
con_arg_200,What's the point of being safe from Covid that you might not get if you observe the social distancing advise  as opposed to taking a vaccine that might actually harm you,alternative_protection
con_arg_201,"but if we maintain social distance, and ensure everybody washes their hands correctly the virus will eventually die off.",alternative_protection
con_arg_202,Obeying social distancing and keeping away from vulnerable people will do the job too,alternative_protection
con_arg_203,"It would be safer if everyone wore a mask in crowded areas, so the vaccine would not be needed",alternative_protection
con_arg_204, Social distancing also reduces this,alternative_protection
con_arg_205, If people will follow safety rules the spreading will be minimize ,alternative_protection
con_arg_206, Good hygiene will help stop the spread and hand washing,alternative_protection
con_arg_207,I am taking the necessary precautions not to spread it to other people.,alternative_protection
con_arg_208,"I am scared it will negatively affect my health, and there will be more harm than good",side_effects
con_arg_209,"I am scared that the vaccine has not had enough time to be developed, and so will be rushed and dangerous",testing
con_arg_210,What if people are too poor to afford it,cost
con_arg_211,Not if the vaccine is irrelevant to a new strain of the virus. ,mutation
con_arg_212,"True, but is a vaccine reliable on a virus we know is quickly mutating with different strains",mutation
con_arg_214,But it is still untested,testing
con_arg_215,i don't think enough testing has been done on it,testing
con_arg_216,Usually but this is getting rushed out,testing
con_arg_217,I am afraid of a vaccine injury since it was developed so fast,testing
con_arg_218,In general vaccines are well researched but in this case the vaccine for covid does not have years of study and you cannot develop a vaccine that will cover  all the strains of the vaccine. So people will still get other forms of the virus even though they were vaccinated,mutation
con_arg_219,I also think that covid 19 has many different strains what if the vaccine does not cover that,mutation
con_arg_220,I am scared of the vaccine because I am not sure about the effects on my health,side_effects
con_arg_221,if you dont have any underlying health conditions covid is rarely dangerous,healthy
con_arg_222,people with no underlying health conditions are not at risk of having complications from covid,healthy
con_arg_223,I have a strong immune system ,healthy
con_arg_224,"only vulnerable people should get the vaccine, I dont need it",vulnerable
con_arg_225,I think vulnerable people should be vaccinated then but not healthy ones as the risk of adverse effects is too great,vulnerable
con_arg_226,vulnerable people are more at risk of covid so they should get one but I would rather take the risk of catching covid,vulnerable
con_arg_227,people in risk groups should get a vaccine. For people who are not at risk I think it's not necessary,vulnerable
con_arg_228,the vulnerable need to get vaccinated then in the first place,vulnerable
con_arg_229,then only the vulnerable should get one then! Why should I expose myself to risks of a rushed vaccie?,vulnerable
